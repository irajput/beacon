<strong>A crowd sourcing website to locate local natural disasters and offer protected locations for affected individuals</strong><br>
The website is built with HTML and CSS and utilizes the Google Maps API. Features include adding map icons to indicate a location a person or family can go to for safety as well as various maps pinpointing sites of nearby recent disasters. The maps are color coded and provides information within a 30 mile radius from the user's location. Future work on this project will be focusing on implementing machine learning algorithms to predict natural disasters that may occur in the future and their locations.
